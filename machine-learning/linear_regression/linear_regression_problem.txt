Linear Regression (Forward)
Your task is to implement linear regression, a statistical model that ends up being the foundation of neural networks. You can learn more from the Complete Explanation of Linear Regression or by reading the description below.

Your must implement get_model_prediction() which returns a prediction value for each dataset value, and get_error() which calculates the error for given prediction data.

Inputs - get_model_prediction:

X - the dataset to be used by the model to predict the output. len(X) = n, and len(X[i]) = 3 for 0 <= i < n.
weights - the current

  weights for the model. len(weights) = 3.
Inputs - get_error:

model_prediction - the model's prediction for each training example. len(model_prediction) = n.
ground_truth - the correct answer for each example. len(ground_truth) = n.
