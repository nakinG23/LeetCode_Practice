Remove Node From End of Linked List
You are given the beginning of a linked list head, and an integer n.

Remove the nth node from the end of the list and return the beginning of the list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4], n = 2

Output: [1,2,4]
Example 2:

Input: head = [5], n = 1

Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 2

Output: [2]
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz
