Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Search Tree
Given a binary search tree (BST) where all node values are unique, and two nodes from the tree p and q, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.

The lowest common ancestor between two nodes p and q is the lowest node in a tree T such that both p and q as descendants. The ancestor is allowed to be a descendant of itself.
